# Stay active
You can put a spoon on your laptop's trackpad... or use this script to keep you active.


## Usage
This script only push the caps lock key once per minute, so your laptop, Teams or Slack will not shut down or go afk.


## Download
Just download your OS (only in Windows and Linux rn) executable in [releases](https://github.com/R-dVL/stay-active/releases).
